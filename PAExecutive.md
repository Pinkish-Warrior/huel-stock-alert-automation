# Hey! We're Huel, and we're pleased to meet you 👋

Our culture thrives on high performance, and we set the bar high for new Hueligans who join us.

We invite you to read the advert below for our new Process Automation Executive position to understand the role, and explore our 7 Huel values before applying to ensure we have the right working environment for you!

The role
As Huel scales globally, we’re doubling down on smart ways of working, and we’re on the hunt for an AI-curious, technically-minded Process Automation Executive to help make it happen.

You’ll turn our pipeline of automation ideas into real impact, helping teams cut the repetitive, manual work that slows them down. From planning sprints to building, testing, and rolling out new automations, you’ll make sure every project delivers measurable value.

You’ll be at the forefront of how we design and scale intelligent workflows that remove friction, speed up processes, and unlock faster, smarter ways of working.

You’ll dive into real business challenges,  understanding how teams work today, mapping out processes, and reimagining them through AI and automation to make work simpler, slicker, and more efficient.

And you won’t just build, you’ll embed. Partnering with teams across the business, you’ll trial, refine, and launch new ways of working, seeing the direct impact of your solutions every day.

This is a first-of-its-kind role in a first-of-its-kind team, giving you the chance to shape the future of work at Huel. Here’s a glimpse of what you’ll be working on:

Shape and deliver automation projects that matter:  You'll own & deliver process improvement initiatives (from idea through to deployment) which roll up into the overall roadmap; communicating well with external partners and internal stakeholders.
Build real things: Design, build, and maintain workflows using n8n (our primary platform), APIs, webhooks, and LLMs; write light JavaScript for custom logic; work with JSON to transform and structure data.
Integrate our tools: Connect Huel’s systems to allow information to flow automatically and accurately.
Test like you mean it: Write test plans, run edge‑case tests, and use sandbox data where appropriate. Support the wider team to peer review and test their builds.
Make it stick: Create clear docs, run short loom videos/teach‑ins, and support go‑lives so teams actually adopt what we build.
Measure impact: Track and report KPIs (time saved, error reduction, SLA improvements, adoption) and iterate to improve.
Do things the right way: Follow our standards for security, privacy, and responsible AI usage; keep logs tidy and data lean.
Stay curious: Scout new AI/automation capabilities, prototype safely, and share what’s useful with the team.

What we're looking for in you
This role is ideal for someone early in their career who’s eager to learn and grow. You might be a recent ai/automation graduate, or perhaps you’ve already gained a few years of hands-on experience in the AI and automation world and you can talk us through your projects. What matters most is your curiosity, drive, and ability to get stuck into real projects. You'll also need to be:

Comfortable learning APIs & JSON. You’ve tried (or are excited to try) calling an API and have some proficiency in data manipulation with JSON, with comfort transforming and structuring data for workflows. You can follow examples and utilise tools to upskill on any knowledge gaps.
Have some coding exposure or passion for wanting to learn it! Any language is fine (JavaScript/Python welcome). You can read and tweak short snippets to make things work.
Clear communicator. You explain your thinking simply, enjoy working with non-technical teammates, and can build trust across different areas of the business. You’ll need to be strong at communication to understand pain points, gather requirements, and guide teams through change while managing projects from start to finish.
Understand Data basics. Confident in spreadsheets; can tidy, filter, and join data. Happy to learn simple SQL when needed.
Systems thinking. You can sketch how information should flow between tools and think through what happens if something fails
Growth mindset. A curious, delivery-focused problem solver who thrives on learning and making things happen.
And as always, we’re on the lookout for new Hueligans who love a fast-paced environment and are always striving to be their best. We want people who aren’t afraid to think differently and push boundaries. If you’re all about setting big goals and believe that amazing things happen through creativity and teamwork, you’ll fit right in at Huel!

What do we offer in return?
We know that at times, our teams face demanding pressures, and exceptional effort deserves meaningful rewards. That's why we've created a world-class perks and benefits program designed to support our Hueligans in achieving their best, both professionally and personally, while celebrating the global impact they're making!
